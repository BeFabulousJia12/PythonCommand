***
CmdAgent.py can work with CmdClient when you need to control other Client(Machine) by remote way. 

1. CmdAgent.py must be started on Client(target PC). 
2. CmdClient.py is stored on the Master PC which is the main controller.  

***
For example, 
Master client could send remote command to Client_01~Client_06 to perform Performance test by CmdAgent.py and CmdClient.py.
